# ⚡ MERALCO PH - API

Konnichiwassup! This is a REST API that scrapes and provides current MERALCO (Manila Electric Company) electricity rates in the Philippines.

MERALCO is the largest electric distribution utility company in the Philippines, serving Metro Manila and nearby provinces. This API automatically fetches the latest monthly electricity rates from MERALCO's official news and advisories, making it easy to integrate real-time rate data into your Home Assistant setup or any other automation platform.

**✨ Features:**

- Automatically detects monthly rate changes (higher/lower rates)
- Caches data to minimize requests (refreshes monthly)
- Returns previous month's rates if current month is unavailable
- Lightweight REST API with health check endpoint
- Docker-ready for easy deployment
- Home Assistant Add-on (Coming soon)

## 🚀 Quick Start (Recommended)

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
services:
  meralco-ph:
    image: ghcr.io/rairulyle/meralco-ph:latest
    container_name: meralco-ph
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - TZ=Asia/Manila
```

Then run:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:5000/rates`

### Alternative: Using Docker run

```bash
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name meralco-ph ghcr.io/rairulyle/meralco-ph:latest
```

## 📡 API Endpoints

- `GET /rates` - Returns current electricity rates
- `GET /health` - Health check

## 🏠 Home Assistant Integration

Add to `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
rest:
  - resource: http://localhost:5000/rates
    scan_interval: 86400 # Once per day
    sensor:
      - name: "MERALCO - Rate"
        unit_of_measurement: "PHP/kWh"
        value_template: "{{ value_json.data.rate_kwh }}"
      - name: "MERALCO - Rate Change"
        unit_of_measurement: "PHP/kWh"
        value_template: "{{ value_json.data.rate_change }}"
      - name: "MERALCO - Rate Change Percent"
        unit_of_measurement: "%"
        value_template: "{{ value_json.data.rate_change_percent }}"
      - name: "MERALCO - Trend"
        value_template: "{{ value_json.data.trend }}"
```
